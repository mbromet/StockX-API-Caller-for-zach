Stockx sales data scraper

Quick data scraper I made for my brother

Makes api calls to the stockx server to get sales data, and downloads it as a txt file.  Due to changes made by stockx, this is currently broken.

Minimum Viable Product features: basically what we need this app to do script that can make api calls to stockx to collect sold product data and compile it into a .csv format
Stretch Features: instead of putting links for products you put various keywords and search stockx, ex. +Air, +Jordan, +5, +Orange, +Black
