wobox stockx scraper
Zach: you need to write out the Minimum Viable Product features, basically what we need this app to do
script that can make api calls to stockx to collect sold product data and compile it into a .csv format

Write out the stretch features(difficult stuff) here: instead of putting links for products you put various keywords and search stockx, ex. +Air, +Jordan, +5, +Orange, +Black
