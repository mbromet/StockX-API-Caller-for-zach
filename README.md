Stockx sales data scraper
Minimum Viable Product features: basically what we need this app to do script that can make api calls to stockx to collect sold product data and compile it into a .csv format

Stretch Features: instead of putting links for products you put various keywords and search stockx, ex. +Air, +Jordan, +5, +Orange, +Black
